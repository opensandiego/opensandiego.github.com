Open San Diego Website
======================

**Built with:**

* `Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>`_
* `Bootstrap 4.2.1 <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/>`_

Setting Up a Local Dev Environment
----------------------------------

* install `node <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_
* install `ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>`_
* run the following commands in your terminal:

   ``gem install jekyll bundler``

   ``bundle install``

Running Locally and Building CSS
----------------------------

To run the website on your local machine:

* run this command in your terminal: ``npm start``
* open a browser and navigate to ``http://127.0.0.1:4000/``

   **Note:**
   the CSS needs to be built and committed at this point, until we figure out a way automatically include the bootstrap dependency

   If you need to make styling changes, you should edit the ``css/main.scss`` file and then build the css with the following command:

   ``npm run build``
